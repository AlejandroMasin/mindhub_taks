                        The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
                        coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
                        detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless
                        of technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                            IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
                            dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be
                            adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older

                            Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues,
                            districts or associations participating in the state competition program that are unable
                            to provide a field that meets these minimum
                            requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee
                            to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                            dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable
                            to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
